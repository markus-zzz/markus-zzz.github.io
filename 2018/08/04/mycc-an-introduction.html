    <p>Today we will be looking at a prototype toy C compiler that I have been working
on every now and then for a while. Of course it is nowhere near complete nor
even useful for any particular purpose at all besides perhaps my own amusement
and possibly that of others.</p>

<p>Still I think that it serves as a meaningful exercise to start from a clean
slate every now and then and do things the way that you feel are right (which
may be the simplest or most naive way possible) and not being burdened by any
particular framework.</p>

<p>Say for instance that you read this really interesting article about
implementing a SSA based register allocator and now you want to try it out. So
you turn to a well established compiler framework like LLVM or GCC. Okay, so
the code base is huge and the compiler build time is insane and you just wanted
to play around a bit. Clearly that situation is not ideal and at these times a
much much simpler and smaller framework would be useful. Preferably one that
still preserves some of the good ideas from the larger ones.</p>

<p>Now I do not want to bash on big compiler frameworks (looking your way LLVM)
but the fact remains that these huge frameworks are not suitable for every
possible purpose and depending on what your intended purpose is they may in
fact make things a lot more complicated than they need to be.</p>

<h2 id="mycc">MyCC</h2>

<p>The design of MyCC borrows heavily from LLVM. One of the best things about LLVM
is the use of a very well defined intermediate representation in the middle
end. This LLVM IR is linearised and resembles assembly language so much that
they in fact call it <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">the LLVM Assembly
Language</a>.</p>

<p>As stated in that document one of the design criteria for the LLVM IR was to
represents well both in graph form in compiler memory as well as in human
readable textual form in dump files. The importance of the latter cannot be
overstated.</p>

<p>While a well defined IR allows us to import and export the entire compilation
state between passes it also allows us to create a virtual machine that can
execute this IR. Together these two provide for the development of some very
powerful testing tool.</p>

<h2 id="preparations">Preparations</h2>
<p>To acquire the code base and build the compiler follow these steps. Note that
the compiler build time for a full debug build is just a second or two (which
is hardly surprising since there is so little code and it is not C++).</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>export ZZZ_ROOT=some/path
cd $ZZZ_ROOT
git clone https://github.com/markus-zzz/mycc.git
mkdir $ZZZ_ROOT/mycc/build
cd $ZZZ_ROOT/mycc/build
make -f $ZZZ_ROOT/mycc/src/Makefile -j8
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Next we run the test suite by executing the following commands.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd $ZZZ_ROOT/mycc/test
./runner.pl
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now what just happened here is actually quite interesting so letâ€™s look into
that. If we enforce the convention that each of our tests shall return a 32 bit
integer as its result (and preferably not just <em>true</em>/<em>false</em> as that would
increase the risk of falsely indicating that a test passes due to a miscompile)
we can do the following.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a reference compiler (e.g. gcc) to produce a known good value</li>
  <li>Use the IR simulator to verify that the IR simulates to the same good value
after each pass</li>
  <li>Verify that the final executable produces the good value</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course this testing is not immune to all kind of problems but I would argue
that it provides a pretty good coverage for rather little effort once you have
the basic machinery in place. To add a new test, simply add a well defined C
code snippet that produces an integer as result.</p>

<h2 id="a-tour-down-the-compilation-pipeline">A tour down the compilation pipeline</h2>
<p>Let us take a look at a simple example and see how the code gets transformed as
we move further down the compilation pipeline. Consider something simple such
as <em>dot.c</em> given below</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>int dot(int *a, int *b, int len)
{
	int i;
	int sum = 0;
	for (i = 0; i &lt; len; i = i + 1) {
		sum = sum + a[i] * b[i];
	}

	return sum;
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Begin by invoking the compiler driver as in</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./build/driver --dump-all dot.c
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>doing so should produce a set of dump files where the intermediate
representation at the given stage is dumped. These files are very important for
debugging since they often times allow you to pinpoint at what stage things go
wrong</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.zzzconsulting.se/download/mycc-an-introduction/ast_00_pristine.txt">ast_00_pristine.txt</a> -
When the front end parses the input code it produces an Abstract Syntax Tree
(AST). This representation is extremely verbose and essentially contains an AST
node for each grammar rule applied.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.zzzconsulting.se/download/mycc-an-introduction/ir_00_pristine.txt">ir_00_pristine.txt</a> -
Middle end Intermediate Representation (what we simply call IR) immediately
after being translated from AST.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.zzzconsulting.se/download/mycc-an-introduction/ir_01_mem2reg.txt">ir_01_mem2reg.txt</a> -
IR after applying the <em>mem2reg</em> optimization pass.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.zzzconsulting.se/download/mycc-an-introduction/cg_00_iselect.txt">cg_00_iselect.txt</a> -
Code Generator intermediate representation after selecting machine instructions
for the middle end IR. Note that this IR is using virtual registers and is
still in SSA form.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.zzzconsulting.se/download/mycc-an-introduction/cg_01_regalloc.txt">cg_01_regalloc.txt</a> -
Machine instructions after allocating physical registers.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.zzzconsulting.se/download/mycc-an-introduction/cg_02_branch_predication.txt">cg_02_branch_predication.txt</a> -
Machine instructions after performing branch predication optimization pass.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h2>
<p>That is it for this post. When we return to MyCC in a later post I intend to
write about the implementation of its SSA based register allocator.</p>
